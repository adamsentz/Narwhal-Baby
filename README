Narwhal Baby is an open-source novel/la about a vampiric narwhal, a lupine walrus, and a rather boring beluga. This is not Twilight satire. I repeat, this is NOT satire.

Ground Rules:
1. A chapter is a file.
2. In order to facilitate diffs, let's preserve newline characters for paragraph breaks. (The way one would naturally write.)
3. If your pull request contains the following words, I will probably reject it completely: veritable (this word has no meaning), robust (unless you're being funny with it), and cold (obviously everything is going to be cold. Think of something else to say).
4. I'm just as new to Git/GitHub as the rest of you, so if I'm doing it wrong, say something.

[PS This is satire.]
